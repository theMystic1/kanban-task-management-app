# Kanban Task Management App

## Overview

The **Kanban Task Management App** is a feature-rich application designed to help users manage tasks effectively using a Kanban board interface. The app is optimized for various screen sizes, includes essential CRUD operations for boards and tasks, and provides a seamless user experience with features like theme toggling and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The app provides an optimal layout for users, whether they're on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states are available for all interactive elements, enhancing the user experience.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete both boards and tasks.
- **Form Validations**: When creating or editing boards and tasks, users receive real-time form validation feedback.
- **Subtasks Management**: Users can mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns as needed.
- **Board Sidebar**: The sidebar can be hidden or shown based on user preference.
- **Theme Toggling**: Users can switch between light and dark modes to suit their preferences.
- **Drag and Drop (Bonus)**: Tasks can be easily dragged and dropped to change their status and reorder them within a column.
- **Persistent Changes (Bonus)**: The app keeps track of changes even after a browser refresh using `localStorage` (if not implemented as a full-stack app).
- **Full-Stack Integration (Bonus)**: The project can be built as a full-stack application, with persistent data storage and advanced features.
